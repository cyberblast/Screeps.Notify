This is a C# adaption inspired by the great [screepers/screeps_notify](https://github.com/screepers/screeps_notify) project. 

This is only the grabber class library - without any application running it. 

The project is based on the C# [cyberblast/Screeps.ApiClient](https://github.com/cyberblast/Screeps.ApiClient) (not included in this repo).

There is a [console application](https://github.com/cyberblast/Screeps.NotifyConsole) project available running this notify library and an azure cloud [service worker](https://github.com/cyberblast/Screeps.NotifyService) project.
