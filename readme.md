This is a C# adaption inspired by the great [screepers/screeps_notify](https://github.com/screepers/screeps_notify) project. 

It's not as complete as the original (e.g. sms still missing) and it's not using a docker container. This is only the grabber class library - without any application running it. 

The project is based on the C# [cyberblast/Screeps.ApiClient](https://github.com/cyberblast/Screeps.ApiClient) (not included in this repo).
