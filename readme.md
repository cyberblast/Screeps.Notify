This is a C# adaption inspired by the great [screepers/screeps_notify](https://github.com/screepers/screeps_notify) project.  
It is based on the C# [cyberblast/Screeps.ApiClient](https://github.com/cyberblast/Screeps.ApiClient) (not included in this repo).

This project only includes the grabber class library - without an application running it. 

There is a [console application](https://github.com/cyberblast/Screeps.NotifyConsole) project available running this notify library to show how it works.
